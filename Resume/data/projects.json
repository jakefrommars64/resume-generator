It needs to be inexpensive, preferably less than $5 per pair, of an under-center style so that the handle covers the mechanism creating a clean and simple appearance, and have a take-up of at least 10mm. It shall be surface mounted using M3 screws and the overall dimensions should not subceed 20mm in width or 40mm in length with a projection not exceeding 13mm.
